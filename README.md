# LegalAI

LegalAI is a cleaned import of a Next.js + Node project focused on making legal information more accessible using AI-powered tools.

This repository contains a single initial import commit. The original commit history and author metadata were intentionally removed during the import.

Quick start (frontend)

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
cd C:\D\Legal AI\legalease-clean
npm install
```

2. Create a local env file (`.env.local`) and set required variables (example):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/legalai
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=replace_with_a_secure_secret
```

3. Run the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3001 (or the port printed by Next).

Notes
- This project requires environment variables for OpenAI, MongoDB, and NextAuth to enable full functionality. Without them, some API routes will return errors in dev (this is expected).
- Recommended deployment: Vercel (first-class Next.js support). You can also use Render or Netlify with appropriate configuration.

If you'd like, I can finish the rebase and push these changes for you.
