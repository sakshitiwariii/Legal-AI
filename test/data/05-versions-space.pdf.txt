Introduction: 
Registration  refers  to the  recording  of  the contents  of a  document with a Registering 
Officer appointed by the Government. The main purpose of registration is to ensure information 
about all deals are recorded and maintained apart from giving the document its authenticity. It 
gives  information  to  the  people  regarding  legal  rights  and  obligations  arising  or  affecting  a 
particular property. The registered documents may afterwards be of legal importance, and also 
aid in preventing fraud. The process of registering a document is done under the provisions of 
the Registration Act, 1908. The main objects of the law of registration are – 
(a) to provide a conclusive proof of genuineness of documents; 
(b) to afford publicity of transaction in respect of properties; 
(c) to prevent fraud; 
(d) to afford facility for ascertaining whether a property has already been dealt with; and 
(e) to afford security of the title deeds and facility of proving titles in case the original 
deeds are lost or destroyed. 
 
Documents generally required for registration 
(a)
 Duly stamped, signed and executed document. 
(b) Two passport size photos of both parties. 
(c) Two witnesses with valid identification proof & photographs. 
(d) Original Stamp Duty receipt. 
(e) Copy of Power Of Attorney in required cases. 
(f) Proof  of  identification  of  each  party  and  witnesses  i.e.  Election  Identity  Card, 
Passport, identity Card issued by Govt. of India, Semi govt. and Autonomous bodies 
or identification by a Gazetted officer. 
(g) In  case  the  property  is/was  under  a  lease  from  any government  authority,  then 
permission of lessor for registration of the document. 
(h) NOC from local authorities if the document for registration conveys land converted as 
house site without the approval layout.

5. LEAVE AND LICENCE: 
Licence is a grant of a right to do something upon an immovable without creating interest in 
the property. A Licence is defined under Sec.52 of the Indian Easements Act, 1882, which 
reads  as  under:  “Where  one  person  grants  to  another,  or  to  a  definite  number  of  other 
persons, right to do, or continue to do, in or upon the immovable property of the grantor, 
something which would, in the absence of such right be unlawful and such right does not 
amount to an easement or an interest in property, the right is called Licence”. The essential 
distinction between a Lease and a Licence is that in a Lease, there is transfer of interest in 
the property while in the case of licence, there is no such transfer although the licensee 
acquires only a personal right to occupy the property.

another, neither thing nor both things being money only, the transaction is called an Exchange. 
A transfer of property in completion of an exchange can be made only in the manner provided 
for the transfer of such property by sale. The difference between a sale and an exchange is that 
in a sale the price is paid in money while in an exchange it is paid in another property by way of 
barter. Sale is always for a price, which means money or the current coin of the realm while no 
price is paid in an exchange, there being only a transfer of one specific property for another.
